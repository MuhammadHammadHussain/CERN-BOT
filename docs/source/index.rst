Autonomous Navigation of Mobile Robots
===================================

Introduction
===================================
The robot is designed to transport heavy loads within CERN radiation facilities, where human presence is hazardous due to high radiation levels. Previously, robots required continuous manual control and monitoring, making it impossible for operators to take breaks and leading to inefficiency and safety concerns. Autonomous navigation enables the robot to operate independently during signal loss or operator absence, improving safety, efficiency, and allowing short operator breaks.

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
